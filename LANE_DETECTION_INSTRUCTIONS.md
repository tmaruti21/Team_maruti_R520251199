# Real-time Lane Detection with Astra Pro Plus Camera

## Overview
This setup allows you to perform real-time lane detection using your Astra Pro Plus depth camera through ROS2.

## Files Created
1. **LaneDetect_ROS2_Realtime.py** - ROS2 node that subscribes to camera feed and performs lane detection
2. **start_lane_detection.sh** - Convenient launcher script

## How to Use

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
Simply run the launcher script from your workspace directory:
```bash
cd ~/depth_cam
./start_lane_detection.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
If you prefer to launch things separately:

**Terminal 1 - Start Camera:**
```bash
cd ~/depth_cam
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch orbbec_camera astra_pro_plus.launch.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Lane Detection:**
```bash
cd ~/depth_cam
source install/setup.bash
python3 src/Lane-Detection/LaneDetect_ROS2_Realtime.py
```

## Controls
- **Press 'q'** in the image window to quit
- **Press 's'** in the image window to start/stop recording
- **Press 'd'** in the image window to toggle debug mode (shows processing steps)
- **Press 'w'** to widen ROI (for far-apart lanes) / **'n'** to narrow (for close lanes)
- **Press 'h'** to increase ROI height (look further) / **'l'** to lower (look closer)

The ROI (Region of Interest) is shown as a blue trapezoid overlay on the image.

## What It Does
- Subscribes to `/camera/color/image_raw` topic from your Astra Pro Plus camera
- **Optimized for BLACK lanes** - automatically inverts the image to detect dark lanes
- Processes frames in real-time using OpenCV with CLAHE contrast enhancement
- Detects lane lines using Canny edge detection and Hough transform
- Displays detected lanes overlaid on the camera feed
- Optionally records the output to `output_astra_realtime.avi`
- Debug mode (press 'd') shows all processing steps

## Tuning for Your Specific Lanes

If the detection isn't working well with your black lanes, use the parameter tuner:

```bash
cd ~/depth_cam
./tune_lane_detection.sh
```

This will show you:
- Live preview of detection at each processing step
- Adjustable sliders for all detection parameters
- Real-time feedback on number of lines detected

Adjust the trackbars until you see good detection, then press 'q' to see the optimal parameters.
The tuner shows:
- **Canny Min/Max**: Edge detection sensitivity
- **Hough Thresh**: Line detection threshold (lower = more lines)
- **Min Line Len**: Minimum line length to detect
- **Min/Max Angle**: Angle range for valid lane lines (25-70° typical)
- **Invert**: Set to 1 for black lanes, 0 for white lanes
- **Use CLAHE**: Contrast enhancement (usually helps with black lanes)
- **Use Morph Filter**: Removes tile boundaries (keep ON for your tiles)
- **ROI Top Width %**: Width of detection area at top - **increase for far-apart lanes, decrease for close lanes**
- **ROI Height %**: How far ahead to look - higher values look further into distance

The blue trapezoid in the tuner shows your ROI. Adjust it to cover your lanes at all distances.

## Accessing Depth Data
If you want to also use depth data from the camera, you can subscribe to:
- `/camera/depth/image_raw` - Depth image
- `/camera/depth/points` - Point cloud (enable with `enable_point_cloud:=true`)

## Troubleshooting

### IMPORTANT: First-Time Setup - Camera Permissions
If you get "uvc_open failed" errors, you need to set up USB permissions:

```bash
# Add yourself to the video group
sudo usermod -aG video $USER

# Install udev rules
sudo bash ~/depth_cam/src/OrbbecSDK_ROS2/orbbec_camera/scripts/install_udev_rules.sh

# UNPLUG AND REPLUG YOUR CAMERA!
# Then log out and log back in (or reboot) for group changes to take effect
```

### Test if camera is working:
```bash
cd ~/depth_cam
./test_camera.sh
```
This will show you if the camera is detected and publishing images.

### If cv_bridge is missing:
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-cv-bridge python3-opencv
```

### Check if camera topics are available:
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 topic list | grep camera
```

You should see topics like:
- /camera/color/image_raw
- /camera/depth/image_raw
- /camera/color/camera_info

### View camera feed directly:
```bash
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
```

## Camera Settings
The camera launches with default settings. You can modify them in:
`src/OrbbecSDK_ROS2/orbbec_camera/launch/astra_pro_plus.launch.py`

Common parameters:
- `color_width` / `color_height`: Resolution (default 640x480)
- `color_fps`: Frame rate (default 30)
- `enable_depth`: Enable/disable depth stream
- `enable_point_cloud`: Enable 3D point cloud

## Notes
- Make sure your Astra Pro Plus camera is plugged into a USB port before running
- The camera needs a few seconds to initialize
- First frame processing might be slower as the node initializes
